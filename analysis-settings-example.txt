## FIDIC SETTINGS
# w0:  target subset size (px)
# Note: smaller subset size is susceptible to larger noise.
# d0:  output subset spacing (px)
# Typically set d0 = w0/4
# inc: set to 0 for cumulative; 1 for incremental comparison
# image_seq: images to correlate. Leave blank to run all images in stack

## CELL VELOCITY PLOTTING
# Cell velocity plotting limits
min_vel: [-0.5]
max_vel: [0.5]
# Downsample factor for quiver plot (reduce number of quivers to see more clearly)
Typically, the quiver plot, the number of quivers needs to be reduced so
qd: [8]
# Quiver size
quiver_size: [3]

## CELL TRAJECTORIES AND MSD SETTINGS
# Timepoints to include for compute_cell_trajectories.m
tstart:
tend:
# fd: factor by which to downsample data (positive integer)
# Final number of grid points should match number of cells.
fd: [2]
# thr: threshold to reject spurious displacement data. Any incremental displacement data greater 
# than this value is set to nan. Use a large value to avoid thresholding
# Units are um
thr: [15]
# Timepoints to include for MSD (0 to 1)
# Set as fraction of total number of timepoints (0 is first timepoint, 1 is last)
nstart: [0]
nend: [1]

## SUBSTRATE TRACTION SETTINGS
# tract_dirname: Name of a folder to put traction plots in
# crop_val: how much to crop substrate displacement data (default is 10)
# umax (um) and tmax (Pa): plotting limits for substrate displacements and tractions
tract_dirname: displ_traction
crop_val: 10
umax: 1
tmax: 500
# IMPORTANT - correct_drift: Set to zero to skip drift-correction (if previously applied before FIDIC)
